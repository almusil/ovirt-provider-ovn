setup_dataplane
=========

This role sets up the data-plane configuration of a sequence of logical ports.

For every network_point it receives, it creates an IP namespace, and an ovs
port, linking it to the corresponding OVN logical switch port. The ovs ports
are made available to the IP namespaces.

When mac & ip addresses are supplied in the network_point abstraction, the
interfaces (ovs ports) are statically configured in the guests (IP namespaces)
based on the addresses reported by ovn. When the IP address is ommitted, the
client configures its IP address - either through a dhcp client, or via RA
messages, depending on the subnet address mode configuration.

The playbook importing this role *needs to* add the ovn controller
container to the inventory, by calling the
[add_host](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/add_host_module.html) module.
